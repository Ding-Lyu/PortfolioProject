              During my master’s studies, I developed a solid understanding of
              the theory required for application in practice, which is
              evidenced by a good GPA performance. And to further develop my
              commercial and practical experience, I have gained valuable
              internships experience of SAAS company. I am currently working as
              a full stack developer at ForSite. At the beginning of the
              project, I worked as a business analyst and was responsible for
              analyzing the requirements of the company's original product
              structure and merging the features of our. Working with the
              project manager to develop the team's road map for 2022. After, I
              have moved into full stack development role where I was
              responsible for troubleshooting functional issues with staging web
              applications, finding the causes and implementing solutions to
              problems as they arose. I also develop front-end pages for project
              owners using JavaScript and bootstrap. I also gained a three-month
              successful internship in project manager at one of the largest
              bicultural architecture and design practice companies, JasMax.
              During this internship, I leaded a group of 4 members developed a
              script application for JasMax and created new scripts by using
              C++. The project was completed and packaged within the required
              time frame and has now been put into internal use.
